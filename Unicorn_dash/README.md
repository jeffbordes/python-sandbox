# 🦄 Unicorn Dash Enhanced

**A magical endless runner game created with love for Merida, Zazil, Bianca & Rea.**

## The Story Behind This Game

My daughters discovered the Google Chrome dinosaur game — you know the one, that little T-Rex that appears when you lose your internet connection. They were hooked. They'd play it over and over, jumping that pixelated dinosaur over cacti, trying to beat each other's high scores.

One day, they asked me: *"Dad, can we have a unicorn version?"*

And just like that, **Unicorn Dash** was born.

This game transforms the simple joy of that classic endless runner into something magical, complete with a majestic unicorn, flowing rainbow mane, sparkle trails, glowing crystals, and fire-breathing dragons. Because if my girls wanted a unicorn, they were going to get the most magical unicorn game I could create for them.

   You asked for a unicorn game, and I hope this
   brings you as much joy to play as it brought
   me to create.
   
   Every sparkle was placed thinking of your
   laughter. Every rainbow trail was drawn
   imagining your smiles. Every magical detail
   exists because you four make my world magical.
   
   May you always chase your dreams as fearlessly
   as this unicorn leaps over obstacles.
   
   May you always leave a little rainbow behind
   wherever you go.
   
   And may you always know that your Dad loves
   you more than all the stars in all the skies
   of all the games ever made.
   
         Keep jumping.
         Keep playing.
         Keep dreaming.
         Keep being amazing.
   
                        Love always,
                              Dad 💜

## 🎨 What Makes This Game Special

Unlike typical games that require downloading sprites, images, and sound files, **Unicorn Dash** generates everything through code:

- **The unicorn** is drawn with mathematical curves and polygons
- **The rainbow mane** flows using sine wave animations
- **Particle effects** are procedurally spawned and faded
- **Sound effects** are synthesized using waveform generation
- **The gradient sky** blends colors pixel by pixel

This means the entire game is contained in a single Python file — easy to share, easy to modify, and easy to learn from.

## 📜 License

This game was created as a personal project for my family. Feel free to play, modify, and share the magic.

**Made with 💜 and a whole lot of Python**
