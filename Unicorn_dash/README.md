# 🦄 Unicorn Dash

**A magical endless runner game created with love for my daughters.**

---

## The Story Behind This Game

My daughters discovered the Google Chrome dinosaur game — you know the one, that little T-Rex that appears when you lose your internet connection. They were hooked. They'd play it over and over, jumping that pixelated dinosaur over cacti, trying to beat each other's high scores.

One day, they asked me: *"Dad, can we have a unicorn version?"*

And just like that, **Unicorn Dash** was born.

This game transforms the simple joy of that classic endless runner into something magical — complete with a majestic unicorn, flowing rainbow mane, sparkle trails, glowing crystals, and fire-breathing dragons. Because if my girls wanted a unicorn, they were going to get the most magical unicorn game I could create for them.
